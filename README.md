#Code-Refactor

In the HTML Code:
Changed the title code so instead of website it says Horiseon so you know what the site is.
First I went through and changed 3 of the div tags to section tags to more clearly seperate the code. Line 12, 33, 61
I then changed another div tag to a nav tag because it corrisponds to the navigation bar. Line 15
I added alt tags to the images. Line 36, 44, 52
I then changed div tags to an aside tag to show that it is for a side bar that doesn't link to anything, just aditional information. Line 63, 71, 79

In the CSS Code:
Because I changed the div in line 15 to a nav tag that messed up some of the CSS code. So i then had to go and change the .header div, .header div ul, and .header nav ul li so that it would instead reflect the nav. Line 27, 35, 39
